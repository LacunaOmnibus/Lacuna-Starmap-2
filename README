This is a starmap plotted with flot used to show players in the game Lacuna Expanse.

It uses a JSON file of data, see example.json file for an example.

Format:
{
   "2" : {        // series number, should match "rank" below
      "info" : [
        // This is what you see when you mouse-over the data in the map. Name, alliance, coordinates.
         "Empire (Alliance) -- Planet : (0, 0) [0|0]"
      ],
      // This is the data to plot, x,y coordinates matching the planet locations. One for each entry in the "info" section.
      "data" : [
         [
            0,
            0
         ]
      ],
      // Alliance name
      "label" : "Alliance",
      // Alliance rank, from the API stats
      "rank" : 2
   },
}
